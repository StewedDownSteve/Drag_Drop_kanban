# My Awesome Project
This was originally from a tutorial. The focus was JS for the drag-and-drop feature. Which I hope to use on future projects.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I built this project using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic and user-friendly drag-and-drop Kanban board. JavaScript was crucial in implementing the drag-and-drop functionality, task creation, and dynamic updates on the Kanban board.


## Optimizations
*(optional)*

One notable optimization was refining the drag-and-drop algorithm to make it more efficient and responsive during user interactions. Additionally, I implemented caching strategies for assets to improve loading times, ensuring a smoother overall experience for users.

## Lessons Learned:

The drag-and-drop JS feature was great to learn. That was the main focus of the tutorial. I chose this as an introduction to a nice dynamic UI for a more complex project I want to make in the future.

When I go back to this project I'm immediately adding a delete button. There currently isn't one. LOL
